                <p>Hello, my name is Kade Christlieb. I am a father to a wonderful daughter and married to my wife Ashley for 3 years. I have many passions in life from anything to do with sports, cooking, all the way to a passion for Disney. I currently live in West Jordan, Utah and I am currently 27 years old. I love to learn new things and am very excited for new adventures to soon come.</p>
                </br>
                <p>My education background is that of an Ass.RN. I choose to change my career path as being behind the keyboard has been a strong intrest of mine as a hobby. I started to get into web development a few years ago with just basic messing around with html and css, until I felt like I needed to learn more. I am excited for what I can learn and know that this is just the begining to a long and exciting jourey ahead.</p>
